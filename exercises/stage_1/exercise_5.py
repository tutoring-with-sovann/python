# Exercise 5: Discount Calculator

# Task: Create a program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount based on the purchase amount. Discounts: 5% for $50–$100, 10% for $101–$200, 15% for above $200.
# Requirements:

# Use input() to get the purchase amount.

# Convert input to a float.

# Use if-elif-else to apply the correct discount.

# Calculate and display the final price.
# Hint: Calculate discount as discount_amount = price * (discount_percentage / 100).
