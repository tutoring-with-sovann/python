# Exercise: Flatten a nested list using loops
# Write a program to flatten a nested list using loops.

# nested_list = [1, [2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 7, [8, 9]]

# Expected output:
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Hint:
# Using type() function, we'll be able to retrieve it's type.
# Usage:
# a_list = []
# is_list = type(a_list) is list

# Output: is_list = True

# Hint:
# Using array.extends(other) to extends the `other` array into the original array
# Usage: 
# a = [1]
# b = [2, 3]
# a.extend(b)
# print(b)
# Output: [1, 2, 3]
