# Note: A Prime Number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1 without remainders (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)

# A Prime Number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers.

# Examples:

# 6 is not a prime number because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
# 37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply to make it.

# find_prime_number(25, 50) => [29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
