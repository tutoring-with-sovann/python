# Imagine you're a teacher, responsible to find any student that isn't tuck in their shirt when they're in a queue.

# You're given a list of student in array format, with their name and their tuck in shirt status as `tuck_in`.

# Given this array of student, return those students that doesn't tuck in their shirt


# a_queue_of_student = [
#   { "name": 'Sok', "tuck_in": True },
