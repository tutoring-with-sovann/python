# Exercise: Count Character Frequency (Case-Insensitive, Ignoring Spaces)
#
# Description:
# You will write a Python program that counts how many times each character appears in a given string.
# This time, the program should:
# - Ignore spaces in the string.
# - Treat uppercase and lowercase letters as the same character (case-insensitive).
# - Ask the user to input the string instead of using a predefined one.
#
# Tasks:
# 1. Ask the user to input a string.
# 2. Convert the string to lowercase for case-insensitive counting.
# 3. Ignore spaces while counting characters.
# 4. Store each character and its count in a dictionary.
# 5. Print the final dictionary showing each character and its frequency.
# 6. Handle empty input with a proper error message.
#
# Example:
# Enter a string: I Love Codingggg
# Character frequency: {'i': 2, 'l': 1, 'o': 2, 'v': 1, 'e': 1, 'c': 1, 'd': 1, 'n': 1, 'g': 4}
#
# Make sure your program passes this checklist:
# [ ] Program asks the user for input.
# [ ] Converts the input string to lowercase.
# [ ] Ignores spaces when counting characters.
# [ ] Handles empty input with an error message.
# [ ] Uses a dictionary to count character occurrences.
# [ ] Uses the `get()` method to update character counts.
# [ ] Prints the final dictionary of character frequencies.
# [ ] Code runs without syntax or runtime errors.
# [ ] Input and output messages are clear and user-friendly.
