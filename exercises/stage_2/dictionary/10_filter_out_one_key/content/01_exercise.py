# Exercise: Managing Product Prices in a Store

# Description:
# You are given two dictionaries representing product prices from two different branches:
# `branchA` and `branchB`.

# Tasks:
# 1. Combine both branch dictionaries into a single dictionary named `all_products`.
# 2. Ask the user to input a product name to update its price.
#    - If the product exists, ask for a new price and update it.
#    - If the product does not exist, display "Product not found."
# 3. After updating, print the updated product list with prices.
# 4. Find and print:
#    - The product with the highest price.
#    - The product with the lowest price.
# 5. Handle the case when all products are removed or if dictionary is empty.
