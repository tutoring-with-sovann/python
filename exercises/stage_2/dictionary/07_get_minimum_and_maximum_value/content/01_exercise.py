# Create a dictionary called 'scores' where the keys are student names and the values are their test scores.

# Find the student with the highest score by comparing the values in the dictionary.

# Find the student with the lowest score by comparing the values in the dictionary.

# Print the dictionary 'scores' first, then print the name and score of the top student and the lowest student.
