# Create a dictionary called 'student' with keys 'name', 'age', and 'grade' and assign some values
# Ask the user to input a key to check
# Use an if statement to check if the entered key exists in the dictionary
# If the key exists print "Key found!"
# If the key does not exist print "Key not found!"
