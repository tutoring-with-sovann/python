# Exercise: Managing a Library Catalog with Unique Books

# Description:
# You are given a nested dictionary called 'library_catalog' containing book records.
# Each record has a unique ID and contains information about the book title, author,
# and genres.

# Some books are duplicates (same title, author, and genres but different IDs).

# Tasks:
# 1. Create a new dictionary 'unique_books' that stores only unique book entries.
#    (Duplicate book records should be removed.)
# 2. Print the final dictionary containing unique books.
# 3. After filtering, print how many unique books are in the catalog.
# 4. Display the titles of all unique books sorted alphabetically.
