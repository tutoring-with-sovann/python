# Exercise: Multiple Child Classes
# Description: Create one parent class with multiple different child classes
#
# Tasks:
# 1. Create an Employee class (parent) with __init__ constructor
# 2. Employee constructor should accept: name, employee_id, salary
# 3. Add a get_details() method
# 4. Create two child classes:
#    - Manager: adds department property and overrides get_details()
#    - Developer: adds programming_language property and overrides get_details()
# 5. Create objects from all three classes
#
# Expected Output:
# Employee: John Doe, ID: E001, Salary: $50000
# Manager: Sarah Smith, ID: M001, Salary: $80000, Department: Sales
# Developer: Mike Johnson, ID: D001, Salary: $70000, Language: Python
