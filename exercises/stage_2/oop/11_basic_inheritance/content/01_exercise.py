# Exercise: Basic Inheritance
# Description: Create a parent Animal class and a child Dog class that inherits from it
#
# Tasks:
# 1. Create an Animal class with __init__ constructor
# 2. Animal constructor should accept: name, age
# 3. Add a method make_sound() that prints "Some generic animal sound"
# 4. Create a Dog class that inherits from Animal
# 5. Dog should have the same constructor as Animal (no additional properties yet)
# 6. Create both Animal and Dog objects to show inheritance
#
# Expected Output:
# Generic animal named Buddy is 5 years old
# Some generic animal sound
# Dog named Max is 3 years old
# Some generic animal sound
#
# Hint: Use class Dog(Animal): to make Dog inherit from Animal. Use pass if you don't need to add anything
