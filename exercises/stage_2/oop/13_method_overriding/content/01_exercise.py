# Exercise: Method Overriding
# Description: Create classes that override parent methods with custom behavior
#
# Tasks:
# 1. Create a Vehicle class with __init__ constructor
# 2. Vehicle constructor should accept: brand, year
# 3. Add a get_info() method that returns basic vehicle information
# 4. Create an ElectricCar class that inherits from Vehicle
# 5. ElectricCar constructor should accept: brand, year, battery_capacity
# 6. Override the get_info() method to include battery information
# 7. Create both Vehicle and ElectricCar objects to show the difference
#
# Expected Output:
# Vehicle Information:
# Brand: Toyota, Year: 2020
#
# Electric Car Information:
# Brand: Tesla, Year: 2023, Battery: 100 kWh
#
