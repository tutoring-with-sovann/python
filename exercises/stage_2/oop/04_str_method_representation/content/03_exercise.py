# Exercise 3: __str__ with Conditional Logic (Hard)
# Description: Create a Task class that displays different messages based on status
#
# Tasks:
# 1. Create a Task class with __init__ constructor
# 2. Constructor should accept: title, priority (1-3), is_completed (default False)
# 3. Implement __str__ method that:
#    - Shows task title
#    - Shows priority as "High", "Medium", or "Low" (1=High, 2=Medium, 3=Low)
#    - Shows "[COMPLETED]" or "[PENDING]" based on is_completed
# 4. Create 3 tasks with different statuses and print them
#
# Expected Output:
# [PENDING] Fix Bug - Priority: High
# [COMPLETED] Write Documentation - Priority: Medium
# [PENDING] Refactor Code - Priority: Low
#
# Hint: Use if-elif-else inside __str__ to determine priority text
