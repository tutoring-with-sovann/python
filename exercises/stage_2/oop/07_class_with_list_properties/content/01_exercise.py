# Exercise: Class with List Properties
# Description: Create a Classroom class that manages a list of students
#
# Tasks:
# 1. Create a Classroom class with __init__ constructor
# 2. Constructor should accept: class_name, teacher
# 3. Initialize an empty list called students in the constructor
# 4. Create the following methods:
#    - add_student(student_name) - adds a student to the list
#    - remove_student(student_name) - removes a student from the list
#    - get_student_count() - returns the number of students
#    - list_all_students() - prints all students in the class
# 5. Create a classroom object and test all methods
#
# Expected Output:
# Math Class taught by Mr. Smith
# Students in class: 0
# Adding students...
# Students in class: 3
# All students:
# 1. Alice
# 2. Bob
# 3. Charlie
# Removing Bob...
# Students in class: 2
# All students:
# 1. Alice
# 2. Charlie
#
# Hint: Use self.students = [] to create an empty list property. Use append() and remove() methods
