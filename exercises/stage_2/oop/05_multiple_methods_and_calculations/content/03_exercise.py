# Exercise 3: Complex Methods with Multiple Operations (Hard)
# Description: Create a Fraction class that performs fraction arithmetic
#
# Tasks:
# 1. Create a Fraction class with __init__ constructor
# 2. Constructor should accept: numerator, denominator
# 3. Create these methods:
#    - simplify() - simplifies the fraction (divide both by GCD)
#    - to_decimal() - returns decimal value
#    - add(other_fraction) - adds another fraction and returns new Fraction
#    - multiply_by(n) - multiplies fraction by integer n
# 4. Create fractions and test all operations
#
# Expected Output:
# Fraction: 6/8
# After simplifying: 3/4
# As decimal: 0.75
# 3/4 + 1/4 = 4/4 = 1/1
#
# Hint: GCD of 6 and 8 is 2. For adding fractions: a/b + c/d = (a*d + b*c)/(b*d)
# You can use a simple GCD function or just manually divide for this exercise
