# Exercise 3: Constructor with Calculations (Hard)
# Description: Create an Employee class that calculates yearly salary
#
# Tasks:
# 1. Create an Employee class with an __init__ constructor
# 2. Constructor should accept: name, hourly_rate, hours_per_week, weeks_per_year
# 3. Set hours_per_week default to 40
# 4. Set weeks_per_year default to 52
# 5. In the constructor, calculate and store yearly_salary (hourly_rate * hours_per_week * weeks_per_year)
# 6. Create 3 employees:
#    - One full-time (use defaults)
#    - One part-time (20 hours/week)
#    - One with custom values for all parameters
# 7. Print each employee's information including yearly salary
#
# Expected Output:
# Employee: John, Hourly Rate: $25.00, Yearly Salary: $52000.00
# Employee: Sarah, Hourly Rate: $30.00, Yearly Salary: $31200.00
# Employee: Mike, Hourly Rate: $50.00, Yearly Salary: $100000.00
#
# Hint: You can perform calculations inside __init__ and store the result as a property
