# Exercise 2: Multiple Comparison Methods (Medium)
# Description: Create a Book class with various comparison methods
#
# Tasks:
# 1. Create a Book class with __init__ constructor
# 2. Constructor should accept: title, author, pages, price
# 3. Create these comparison methods:
#    - is_same_author(other_book) - compares authors
#    - is_longer_than(other_book) - True if more pages
#    - is_more_expensive_than(other_book) - True if higher price
# 4. Create 3 books and perform comparisons
#
# Expected Output:
# Book 1: Python Basics by John (300 pages, $29.99)
# Book 2: Advanced Python by John (450 pages, $39.99)
# Book 3: Java Programming by Sarah (280 pages, $34.99)
# Same author (Book1 & Book2)? True
# Book1 longer than Book3? True
# Book2 more expensive than Book1? True
#
# Hint: Use comparison operators (<, >, ==) to compare properties
