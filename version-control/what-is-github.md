# What is GitHub?

## Introduction

GitHub is a website where programmers store and share their code. Think of it as a combination of:
- **Google Drive** for code (store and backup your projects)
- **Time machine** (go back to any previous version of your code)
- **Collaboration tool** (work on code with friends or teammates)

## Why Should You Use GitHub?

### 1. **Never Lose Your Work**
- Your code is safely stored in the cloud
- Even if your computer breaks, your code is safe
- You can access your projects from any computer

### 2. **Track Your Changes**
- See what you changed and when
- Go back to a previous version if something breaks
- Understand how your project evolved over time

### 3. **Show Off Your Projects**
- Create a portfolio of your programming work
- Colleges and employers look at GitHub profiles
- Demonstrate your skills with real projects

### 4. **Learn from Others**
- Explore millions of open-source projects
- See how experienced programmers write code
- Use free code libraries to enhance your projects

### 5. **Collaborate with Others**
- Work on group projects with your classmates
- Multiple people can work on the same project
- Track who made what changes

## Key Concepts

### Repository (Repo)
A repository is like a project folder that contains all your code files and the history of changes. Each project gets its own repository.

**Example:** You might have repositories named:
- `my-first-game`
- `calculator-app`
- `school-projects`

### Commit
A commit is like a "save point" in a video game. It captures a snapshot of your project at a specific moment in time, with a message describing what you changed.

**Example commit messages:**
- "Added player movement to the game"
- "Fixed bug where calculator crashes on division by zero"
- "Completed homework assignment #5"

### Branch
A branch lets you work on new features without affecting your main code. Think of it like creating a copy to experiment with - if the experiment works, you can merge it back into the main version.

### Clone
Cloning means downloading a copy of a repository from GitHub to your computer so you can work on it.

### Push
Pushing means uploading your changes from your computer to GitHub.

### Pull
Pulling means downloading the latest changes from GitHub to your computer.

## Git vs GitHub - What's the Difference?

- **Git**: The software/tool that tracks changes to your code (runs on your computer)
- **GitHub**: The website that hosts your code online and makes it easy to share

Think of it this way:
- Git is like Microsoft Word (the program)
- GitHub is like OneDrive (the cloud storage service)

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're writing a book with your friends:

1. **Repository**: The shared folder where the book is stored
2. **Commit**: Each time someone saves a chapter with notes like "Added Chapter 3"
3. **Branch**: Someone creates a copy to try a different ending
4. **Push**: Uploading your chapter so others can see it
5. **Pull**: Downloading the latest chapters your friends wrote
6. **Merge**: Combining everyone's chapters into the final book

## What Can You Store on GitHub?

### Good for GitHub:
- Python code (`.py` files)
- Documentation (`.md`, `.txt` files)
- Configuration files
- Small data files
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for websites

### Not Good for GitHub:
- Large video files
- Personal passwords or secret keys
- Homework answers you shouldn't share
- Copyrighted material you don't own

## GitHub in the Real World

Many famous projects are on GitHub:
- **Visual Studio Code** - the code editor many programmers use
- **Python** - the Python programming language itself
- **TensorFlow** - Google's machine learning library
- **React** - Facebook's web framework

Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook use GitHub every day!

## Next Steps

Now that you understand what GitHub is, you're ready to:
1. Set up your GitHub account
2. Install Git on your computer
3. Create your first repository
4. Start backing up your Python projects

Let's move on to setting up GitHub!
