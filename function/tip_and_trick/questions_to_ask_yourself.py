# Before creating a function you should ask:

# 1. What is the functionâ€™s purpose?
# 2. What inputs does the function need?
# 3. What output should the function return?
# 4. Is this functionality already available?
# 5. How can the function be made reusable?
# 6. What should the function be named?
