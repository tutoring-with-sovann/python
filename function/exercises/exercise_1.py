# Exercise 1: Calculate Factorial
# Question: Write a function that takes a non-negative integer and returns its factorial.
# The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
# For example, factorial(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. Return None for negative inputs.

# Usage
# print(f"Factorial of 5: {factorial(5)}")  # Output: Factorial of 5: 120
# print(f"Factorial of 0: {factorial(0)}")  # Output: Factorial of 0: 1
# print(f"Factorial of -1: {factorial(-1)}")  # Output: Factorial of -1: None
