# Exercise 3: Sum of Even Numbers in a List
# Question: Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.
# If the list is empty or contains no even numbers, return 0.

# Usage
# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# print(f"Sum of even numbers in {numbers}: {sum_even_numbers(numbers)}")  # Output: Sum of even numbers in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]: 12
# empty_list = []
# print(f"Sum of even numbers in {empty_list}: {sum_even_numbers(empty_list)}")  # Output: Sum of even numbers in []: 0
# odd_list = [1, 3, 5]
# print(f"Sum of even numbers in {odd_list}: {sum_even_numbers(odd_list)}")  # Output: Sum of even numbers in [1, 3, 5]: 0
